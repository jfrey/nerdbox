// Package vm defines the hypervisor-agnostic interface used by nerdbox to
// manage the lifecycle of a microVM and its guest agent (vminitd).
//
// A [Manager] is the entry point for creating VM instances. Each [Instance]
// represents one running VM and exposes:
//
//   - configuration methods (SetCPUAndMemory, AddFS, AddDisk,
//     AddPmemImage, AddNIC) that must be called before [Instance.Start];
//   - lifecycle methods ([Instance.Start] and [Instance.Shutdown]);
//   - communication channels ([Instance.Client] for the TTRPC control plane
//     and [Instance.StartStream] for raw byte streams) that are valid only
//     after a successful Start.
